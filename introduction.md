# Introduction

Hello!

Welcome to **Fullstack's 30 Days of React Native** - an introduction to the React Native framework in 30 bite-sized morsels.

</p>

If you've never used React Native before and are interested in getting started, welcome! We always encourage newcomers to first peruse the [React Native Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) since the React Native docs are quite good (and we even helped write them!).

With 30 Days of React Native, we've attempted to make this resource **as welcoming as possible for complete newcomers**. We'll be keeping everything as _lightweight_ as possible and look to demonstrate concepts with simple to follow examples. If you're already familiar with HTML, CSS, and have a little understanding of JavaScript - you've come to the right place!

Cheers!
Devin Abbott & Houssein Djirdeh

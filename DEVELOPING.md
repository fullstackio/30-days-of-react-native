# Developing 30 Days of React Native

It's recommended that you use [`cq`](https://github.com/fullstackio/cq) for your code loading. To do this, do the following:

```
# install cqmd
npm install -g @fullstackio/cqmd

# go into your day folder
cd day-01

# generate a standard markdown file from a cq.markdown
cqmd -o day-01.md day-01.cq.md
```
